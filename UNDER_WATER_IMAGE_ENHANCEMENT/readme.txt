Underwater images mainly suffer from the problem of poor color contrast
and poor visibility. These problems occur due to the scattering of light and
refraction of light while entering from rarer to denser medium. Scattering
causes the blurring of light and reduces the color contrast. As a result,
important information from the image also gets lost. There are many
approaches have been proposed to solve this problem like Histogram
Equalization and Integrated Color Model. This method restore the
contrast, color and lost information from images by applying simplest color
balance and contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization method.
